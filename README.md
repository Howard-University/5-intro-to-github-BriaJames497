#### Hello, my name is Bria James I am a Pre-Law History Major, Political Science Minor from Mount Vernon, NY. In this course, I hope to learn more about simplifying data analysis. When you have large amounts of data (hundreds) it can be hard to filter and sort through it to find exactly what you're looking for so I want to learn about making that process easier.
